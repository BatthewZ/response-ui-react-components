   * no exit animation while every later one did.
   *
   * **This test does not falsify that defect, and neither does any other test in

   * green, as did the whole suite. jsdom does not reproduce React's replay, and
   * the symptom was a *paint* — the class reached the DOM and the browser never
   * started the animation, so every computed style an assertion could read was
   * already correct (`memory/README.md` §16). It was found, and can only be
   * found, by measuring `animationstart`/`animationend` in a real browser.
   *
   * What it does hold is the observable contract on the first swap after mount
   * under a double-invoked render, which is worth pinning even though it is not
   * the guard. Do not read a green here as cover for a motion change.
