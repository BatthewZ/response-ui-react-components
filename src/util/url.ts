 * parses rather than renders, so a link in it comes from wherever the source
 * came from. The answer is not specific to markdown, though: anything rendering
 * a URL it did not write needs it, and this library renders plenty of them
 * (`Avatar`, `Hero`, `MediaCard` and `Spotlight` all take a `src`) without
 * asking. It sits here now so a consumer can ask the same question about a URL
 * from their CMS, their API, or a model, and get the same answer this library
 * gives itself.
